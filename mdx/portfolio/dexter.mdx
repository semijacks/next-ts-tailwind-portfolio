I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! You all right, Dexter? Like a sloth. I can do that. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I have a dark side, too.

I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. God created pudding, and then he rested. I have a dark side, too. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.
