# Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.

Tell her she looks thin. Why would I want to know that? Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! **We have bigger problems.** _You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing._ We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.

## I love you, buddy!

Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Who am I making this out to? I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Negative, bossy meat creature!

1. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!
2. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
3. So, how 'bout them Knicks?

### We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.

Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Bender, quit destroying the universe!

- Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.
- Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!
- With gusto.

You are the last hope of the universe. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.

Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!

Guess again. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.

Then we'll go with that data file! Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Oh God, what have I done? Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.

You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

No! Don't jump! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.

You are the last hope of the universe. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Hey, whatcha watching?

Why would I want to know that? Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Okay, I like a challenge.

Can I use the gun? Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!

Leela's gonna kill me. When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!

Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Do a flip! Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be fearedâ€¦ I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!
